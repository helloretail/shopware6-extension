// Counting these is the point: a rewrite that quietly matches nothing is precisely the failure this script
// exists to end, so "no error" must never be mistaken for "the hosts were applied".
//
// Know what patched does NOT prove: it counts a file on disk carrying our hosts, never that the storefront
// RENDERS that file. Full reachability is not checked here, and could not be without rendering a page.
// On the current image the two candidates are not equal in that respect. The template that actually reaches
// the browser is component/hello-retail-tracking.html.twig, and it gets there through the plugin copy of
// storefront/base.html.twig, which sw_includes it inside the storefront block `base_script_csrf`. The
// plugin layout/meta.html.twig sw_includes the very same component from `layout_head_javascript_csrf` -- a
// block the vendor meta.html.twig nests inside a feature(FEATURE_NEXT_15917) condition that is off -- so
// that override is inert: it compiles, it is patched, and it never renders. Confirmed live with injected
// markers: a marker in meta.html.twig does not appear in the page, one in base.html.twig does.
//
// So a plain "patched > 0" gate is too weak: the inert meta override alone can satisfy it while the
// component that does render is unmatched, which is a storefront on the PRODUCTION hosts with exit 0.
// The obvious tightening -- demand that EVERY present candidate be resolved -- is wrong in the other
// direction: on this very image meta.html.twig is present and carries no init call at all, so that rule
// fails the normal, working case. What the two candidates differ in is not presence but render authority,
// and that we do know: $renders below marks the candidate verified to reach the browser where it exists.
// An unmatched call in THAT file is fatal even when a sibling patched, because the patched sibling cannot
// stand in for it. The residual, and it stays a residual: a future plugin that carries the init call only
// in meta.html.twig, in a block that likewise does not render, still scores patched = 1 and exits 0. That
// one needs a rendered page to catch, and this gate does not render one.
